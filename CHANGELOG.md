# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- A README banner. The README is the whole npm listing, since npm has no package icon
  field, so this is the package's only branding surface.

### Fixed

- `biome.json` pointed at the 2.3.11 schema after the bump to 2.5.12, which biome reported
  as an info diagnostic on every run.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Expose `./package.json` through the `exports` map. Without it, tooling that reads a
  dependency's `package.json` — a common pattern — fails with
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- TypeScript 7, and `pg` to 8.23, `@inquirer/prompts` and `@biomejs/biome` to their current
  releases. Verified against a real database container through both the CLI and the
  programmatic API, not on a green type-check alone.
- `@types/node` is named explicitly in `tsconfig.json`. TypeScript 7 no longer reliably
  auto-includes it, which left every Node global — `console`, `process`, `URL`,
  `setTimeout` — unresolved.

### Note

The 1.2.0 entry originally listed these dependency updates, but they were not in that
release; only the Node 22 floor, the `nodenext` move and the Actions bumps were. That entry
has been corrected and the updates ship here.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22.** Node 20 reached end of life on
  30 April 2026. This also fixes a latent bug: `@inquirer/prompts` v8 is ESM-only, and
  `require()` of an ES module only works from Node 20.19 onward — so interactive mode was
  broken on Node 20.0 through 20.18, which the previous `>=20` range claimed to support.
- Moved to `nodenext` module resolution, which correctly models Node 22+ being able to
  `require()` an ES module.
- Updated the GitHub Actions to their current majors.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- A programmatic API. `PostgresAnalyzer` is exported from the package root, alongside the
  analyzers, collectors, reporters and every report type. Importing the package now has
  no side effects — previously `require("@deniscuciuc/pg-analyzer")` connected to the
  database and ran an analysis, because the CLI was the package entry point and
  `main`/`types` pointed at it. The CLI moved to `src/cli/main.ts` and is still reached
  through the `pg-analyzer` binary.
- A test suite. `pnpm test` runs it, and CI runs it on Node 20, 22 and 24.
- `SECURITY.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### Fixed

- `--watch -1` was mistaken for a flag and silently replaced by the default interval
  instead of being rejected.
- Numeric flags were parsed with no validation, so `--port abc` produced `NaN` and
  surfaced as a confusing driver error far from the actual mistake. Each flag now reports
  its own name.
- A flag at the end of the argument list stored `undefined` rather than failing.
- An unknown flag was silently ignored, so a typo like `--jsno` produced human-readable
  output instead of JSON.
- The connection is no longer torn down by an unhandled `error` event: with no listener
  attached, an idle-connection failure terminated the process, which was near-certain in
  `--watch` mode.
- Ctrl+C during a query did nothing, and a second Ctrl+C did nothing either, so the CLI
  appeared to hang. A second signal now exits, and `SIGTERM` is handled so `docker stop`
  reaches the connection cleanup.
- `process.exitCode` is set instead of calling `process.exit`, which could truncate
  buffered output when piping `--json` to a file.

### Changed

- The npm tarball no longer contains the compiled tests.
- Stricter TypeScript (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and friends) and Biome rules; unused
  variables and imports are errors rather than warnings.
- CI runs on every branch, not just `main` and `develop`, and cancels superseded runs.
- Publishing now emits npm provenance and verifies the tag matches `package.json`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- PostgreSQL database analyzer CLI with subcommands
- Unused / missing / duplicate index detection with `DROP INDEX` generation
- Foreign key index gap detection
- Slow query analysis via `pg_stat_statements`
- Table bloat detection and VACUUM management
- Database health score (0–100) with prioritized recommendations
- Connection, cache, and configuration metrics
- Interactive CLI mode with prompts
- Markdown report generation to `./reports/`
- JSON output for automation workflows (`-j` flag)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (lint, build matrix)
- GitHub Actions publish workflow
- Dependabot configuration for npm + GitHub Actions
- MIT license
- Makefile with common development targets
- Config-file support via `.analyzerrc.json`, global fallback config, and named connection profiles
- Schema and table filters for scoped PostgreSQL analysis runs
- Self-contained HTML report generation with light/dark mode and sortable sections
- Report diffing against previous JSON snapshots with delta summaries
- Watch mode for polling-safe commands with refresh intervals and countdown feedback
- `pnpm analyze:html` and `pnpm analyze:watch` convenience scripts
- Global CLI publishing via `npm install -g @deniscuciuc/pg-analyzer` and `npx @deniscuciuc/pg-analyzer`

### Changed

- Full analysis output can now generate Markdown, JSON, and optional HTML reports from the same run
- Compare mode accepts saved JSON reports and wrapped CLI JSON output when diffing snapshots

### Fixed

- Explicit `--profile` selection now overrides sourced environment connection defaults for the active run
